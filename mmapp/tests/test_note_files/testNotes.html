Two types of software on a computing system
System software - OS and utilities
Application software - programs (things that you usually refer to as programs)
Operating system - is a resource manager of both time and space 
Manages the resources of a computer, including the CPU, the main memory (RAM), and I/O devices (devices that receives and sends data to external sources from the CPU)
I/O devices receive read and write requests from programs running on CPU (sent by the CPU running the program), and they carry it out
When a program needs some I/O from a certain device (input or output) it sends the request to the device to do that operation
Different techniques in handling this process (how does the CPU handle waiting for the operation to be completed)
Standard input: keyboard, standard output: screen
Different output devices do exists
When a I/O device is being “used” by a program (handling a request from a program, can’t be used by others)
Acts to hide the complexity of the underlying hardware from the user and give the user a better view (an abstraction) of the computer
Roles of an OS:
Referee
Resource allocation among users and applications (CPU, RAM etc.)
Note that the OS can generate some applications/run some programs/start some processes which can compete with user started processes/applications
Isolation of different users and applications from each other
Prevent users and applications from affecting each other
Communication between users and applications
Allow different programs and users to transfer data
Illusionist
To make every application think it has the full machine to itself
Has the entire CPU, RAM to use
The application has no idea that other applications may be running on the same machine using the same resources
To make the application think it has infinite resources (memory, processors) and reliable storage and network
So programmers can write applications with the perception that they have infinite resources
Sometimes illusion needs to be broken if what the application is requesting is simply not possible (requesting use of disk space that does not exist etc.)
Glue
Libraries, user interface widgets etc….
Why study OS?
The specific abstractions of an OS can affect an application/program’s software
